**Project: Comprehensive Stock Market Analysis and Visualization**

I present an extensive analysis of stock market data from 2016 to 2020 for technology giants including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. The project's objective is to uncover valuable insights into historical stock performance and provide users with dynamic visualizations for well-informed decision-making.

**Enhanced Data Insights with Python's Pandas Library:**

To empower this analysis, I've harnessed the capabilities of Python's powerful pandas library. The dataset has been enriched with critical metrics, including:

1. **Previous Day's Close Price:** Contextualizes price movements by incorporating the close price of the day before.

2. **Change in Price:** Quantifies absolute price changes from one day to the next, offering insights into volatility.

3. **Percentage Change in Price:** Calculates the percentage change in price to provide a clear understanding of magnitude.

4. **Previous Day's Volume:** Adds the volume of the previous day to enable analysis of trading activity trends.

5. **Change in Volume:** Measures absolute changes in trading volume, aiding the identification of market interest shifts.

6. **Percentage Change in Volume:** Computes the percentage change in trading volume to assess evolving market sentiment.

**Interactive Tableau Dashboard:**

The project includes an interactive Tableau dashboard that offers intuitive visualizations of the enriched insights. The dashboard comprises the following interactive elements:

1. **Volume vs. Date Graphs:** A series of graphs illustrating the correlation between trading volume and date for each technology company. These visuals offer insights into volume trends and their potential impact on prices.

2. **Percent Change Tables:** Tables presenting percentage changes in price and volume over the specified time frame. These tables provide a snapshot of volatility and shifting market dynamics.

3. **Price Percent Change and Moving Average Graphs:** The dashboard includes components highlighting price percent changes and moving averages for the open price. These insights empower traders and analysts to identify trends and potential entry/exit points.

4. **Percent Change in Price and Volume Tables:** As requested, the dashboard now presents tables showcasing percentage changes in price and volume. These tables provide a clear overview of market dynamics.
