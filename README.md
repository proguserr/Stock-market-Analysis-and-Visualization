# Stock-market-Analysis-and-Visualization



This project focuses on a detailed analysis of stock market data from 2016 to 2020 for major technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. The primary goal is to derive meaningful insights from historical stock performance and present them through dynamic visualizations, helping users make informed decisions based on trends and data.

### **Data Enrichment and Analysis Using Python's Pandas Library**

I leveraged Python's powerful Pandas library to enrich the stock market dataset and conduct comprehensive analyses. Key metrics were calculated to provide deeper insights, such as:

- **Previous Day's Close Price**: This metric adds context to daily price movements by incorporating the closing price of the previous day.
  
- **Change in Price**: Measures the absolute price change from one day to the next, offering a clear view of market volatility.
  
- **Percentage Change in Price**: Calculates the percentage price change to convey the magnitude of daily price fluctuations.
  
- **Previous Day's Volume**: Captures the trading volume of the prior day, facilitating analysis of historical trading activity trends.
  
- **Change in Volume**: Quantifies the absolute change in daily trading volume, helping identify shifts in market interest.
  
- **Percentage Change in Volume**: Computes the percentage change in volume, offering insights into changes in market sentiment and investor behavior.

### **Interactive Tableau Dashboard**

To visualize these enriched insights, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard. This user-friendly tool offers multiple dynamic visualizations and tables to explore stock market performance, including:

- **Volume vs. Date Graphs**: Interactive graphs that illustrate trading volume trends over time for each company. These graphs help users analyze how fluctuations in trading volume align with key price movements.
  
- **Percent Change Tables**: These tables summarize percentage changes in both price and volume over the selected timeframe, allowing users to easily identify periods of high volatility and market shifts.
  
- **Price Percent Change and Moving Averages Graphs**: The dashboard highlights trends in price percentage changes and moving averages of stock prices, providing actionable insights for traders. These graphs can help users spot potential trends, entry, and exit points for trading.
  
- **Percentage Change in Price and Volume Tables**: A detailed table showing percentage changes in price and volume, allowing for a quick comparison of market activity and sentiment shifts across the analyzed companies.

By integrating these features, this project provides both analysts and traders with a powerful tool to understand historical stock performance, offering the capability to explore detailed metrics, trends, and visual insights for more informed decision-making.
